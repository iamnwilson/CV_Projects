About
Playing with friends is pure fun but getting ahead of them is even more enjoyable. Invite a friend to play the Last Pencil, a game where you decide who wins. In this project, your opponent is a computer that is an expert in the game. But it's up to you to choose who wins.

Stage 1/5: Empty the pencil case
It was a boring day, so your friend came up with the idea of creating a simple game.
Stage 2/5: New rules
Let's change the game a little bit and add new conditions.
Stage 3/5: Working on the gameplay
You've decided to try out new game mechanics and take turns until no pencils remain.
Stage 4/5: Fair play
You took all the pencils in one turn. Your friend decided that it was unfair and somehow took a negative number of pencils! Who is the winner? Let's add the winning condition!
Stage 5/5: The right strategy
You've played several games and found out that there's only one winning strategy. Your friend suggested implementing a bot to add a certain degree of randomness to the game.
