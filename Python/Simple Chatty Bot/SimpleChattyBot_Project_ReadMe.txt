About
Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding. During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own. Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!

Stage 1/5: Chatty bot welcomes you
Teach your assistant to introduce itself in the console.
Stage 2/5: Print your name
Introduce yourself to the bot.
Stage 3/5: Guess the age
Use your knowledge of strings and numbers to make the assistant guess your age.
Stage 4/5: Learning numbers
Your assistant is old enough to learn how to count. And you are experienced enough to apply a while loop at this stage!
Stage 5/5: Multiple choice
At this point, the assistant will be able to check your knowledge and ask multiple-choice questions. Add some functions to your code and make the stage even better.
