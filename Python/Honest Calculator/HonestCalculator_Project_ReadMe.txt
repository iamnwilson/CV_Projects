Honest Calculator

Learning outcomes
Learn how to read flowcharts to hone your understanding of loops, conditions, and algorithms. It will allow you to write your own algorithms. This skill also prevents multiple changes from occurring during production.

About
The International Union Against Idleness (IUAI) announced a competition for an application that would motivate users. There are prizes involved. Since you like competing and know a little bit about programming, you asked your friend to prepare an interesting algorithm for a quick buck. Unfortunately, you weren't clear enough, and instead of a ready-made program, a friend prepared a flowchart of Honest Calculator. You will have to put some effort into assembling it.



Working on the project, you're at first required to build a simple calculator which later on is going to motivate users to try and do the math themselves by becoming more and more honest with them. For example, if they need to do calculations with multi-digit numbers, that, okay, might be tricky, so the calculator won't be very hard on them and just solve it. However, if the equation is a simple sum of two integers like 2 + 3, maybe it should suggest solving it themselves. Even worse, if it's multiplication by one or zero, that is just of the line! After all, it's a competition organised by the International Union Against Idleness.

Stage 1/5: Data collection
Collect data and check if users were attentive in school.
Stage 2/5: First calculations
Perform the first calculations and check if users know how to handle zero.
Stage 3/5: Total recall
Sometimes the numbers are so big that you have to store them. Implement this feature!
Stage 4/5: The laziness test
Now, it is time to tell users what the calculator thinks about equations.
Stage 5/5: Saving memory
Electricity costs money, the processor overheats, the memory fills up, so you have to watch what users want to store.
