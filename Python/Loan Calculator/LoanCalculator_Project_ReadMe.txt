Loan Calculator

Learning outcomes
You will practice using mathematics and Python in everyday tasks and learn how to use third-party modules and libraries. You will also learn more about different financial instruments. At one point, you will need to parse arguments, so working on this project is a great opportunity to get to know the command-line interface (CLI) better as well.

About
Personal finances are an important part of life. Sometimes you need some extra money and decide to take a loan, or you want to buy a house using a mortgage. To make an informed decision, you need to be able to calculate different financial parameters. Let’s make a program that can help us with that!

Stage 1/4: Beginning
Create a simple program that will print messages about loan calculations.
Stage 2/4: Dreamworld
Communicate with the user to get input values, do some simple mathematical operations, and output the result.
Stage 3/4: Annuity payment
Calculate real loan parameters using Python’s mathematical capabilities.
Stage 4/4: Differentiate payment
Make the loan calculator able to work with different types of payment and accept command-line arguments.
